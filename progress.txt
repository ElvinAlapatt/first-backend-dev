I am using nestjs for my backend in angular project

nest new <projectname> creates a new nest project
the app.module.ts is the main entry point 

Just like components in front end we have modules in backend 
Every module has module.ts , service.ts , controller.ts 
to create a module using nest cli -: npm g module <modulename>
in a project auth is a module just to give an example;

controllers are responsible for handling requests and sending responses back to the client
